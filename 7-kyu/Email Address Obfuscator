/**
* Many people choose to obfuscate their email address when displaying it on the Web. One common way of doing this 
* is by substituting the @ and . characters for their literal equivalents in brackets.
*
* Using the examples above as a guide, write a function that takes an email address string and returns the obfuscated 
* version as a string that replaces the characters @ and . with [at] and [dot], respectively.
